### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that software is functional and secure, a plan should be created, starting with defining requirements, goals, and constraints. The appropriate programming language and development tools should be used based on the project's needs, and code should be readable, modular, and well-organized, and well documented for future reference. Code should be tested thoroughly, both manually and through automated testing, to ensure that it works as intended and to identify any potential security vulnerabilities. Finally, software should be regularly updated and maintained to address any bugs or security issues that may arise over time. 

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

As a software developer, it's crucial to understand and interpret user needs in order to create a program that truly meets their requirements. The first step is to communicate effectively with the user and gather all necessary information about the program's purpose and features. The right questions should be asked to ensure that there is a clear understanding of needs and goals. Next, those needs should be analyzed and prioritized to determine the most critical requirements for the program. It's also important to involve the user in the development process and provide regular updates to ensure that the program meets their expectations. Additionally, user testing should be conducted to gather feedback and identify any issues that need to be addressed. Finally, user feedback should incorporated into the program and necessary adjustments should be made to ensure that it's functional, user-friendly, and meets the needs of the user.

### How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by first thoroughly understanding the requirements and desired functionality of the program, and then begin deciding the best way to implement. If the requirements have been collected correctly and are thorough enough, sometimes the best possible answer arises from common sense. If the right approach is object oriented, then models can be created to outline the necessary objects and functions that they should be capable of, which should be simple enough to translate into code. After this, encapsulation and polymorphism should be taken into account to keep the software maintainable, modular, scalable, reusable, and efficient. Any additional features that might be useful can be discovered and implemented during testing, and hopefully there will be regular meetings and checkpoints with stakeholders to decide best next steps and any features they like, dislike, or want changed.
